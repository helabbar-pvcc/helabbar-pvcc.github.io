If there is a collision on the bus, the host will wait a random amount of time and then attempt to resend until the packet is sent.</li>
                <li>CSMA/CA Wifi:"Carrier Sense, Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance". On wireless networks, a host will wait until there is a channel that has been silent for a certain amount of time then transmits. If a collision happens, the host will wait a short period of time then attempt to retransmit.</li>

                <li>Bridge: Like a repeater but it searches the signals and is more efficient. It looks at the destination address for each message and only fowrads it when its destined for a computer on the other side. Links two seperate LANs, useful for segmenting networks and extending them.  </li>
                <li>Switch: Essentially a bridge with multiple connections, allowing it to connect several buses rather than just two.</li>
                <li>Router: Useful for connecting faraway networs, and they store data thats delivered in the form of packers. Different from the above becausew it provides links between networks while allowing them to keep their unique internal characteristics.</li>
                <li>Gateway: A router that provides access to an external network to devices on a local network such as the Internet.</li>

                <li>Transport Layer: Accepts messages from the application layer and ensures that the messages are properly formatted for transmission over the internet. It divides the messages into small bits and sends them individually to make the transfer go smoothly.These segments are know as packets.</li>
                <li>Network Layer: Determins where a packet has to go, and then gives the packet to the link layer for transmission. (Think of the machine that tapes labels to boxes being shipped.)</li>
                <li>Link Layer: In charge of receiving and transmitting packets.It recieves it and then hands it up to the network layer to determine where it should go next.  </li>
